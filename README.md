# 🍽️ Responsive Recipe App

A fully responsive Recipe App built using **vanilla web technologies**—HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript. This project was developed as part of my self-driven front-end learning journey to simulate a real-world workflow and sharpen UI/UX design skills without relying on any frameworks or libraries.

## 🌟 Key Features

- 🔧 **Built with HTML5 & CSS3**: Semantic HTML and modern CSS (Flexbox, Grid) ensure a structured, scalable, and responsive layout across all screen sizes.
- 🎨 **Clean & Modern UI**: Carefully styled using CSS with hover effects, intuitive spacing, and a focus on user experience.
- 🔍 **Dynamic Search**: Search for recipes using keywords. JavaScript fetches data from a public recipe API and dynamically renders the content.
- 📱 **Responsive Design**: Works seamlessly on desktops, tablets, and smartphones.
- ⚙️ **DOM Interactions**: Implemented interactivity like recipe detail toggling using event listeners and DOM manipulation.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
